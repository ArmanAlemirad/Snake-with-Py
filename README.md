# Learning python by creating the game snake
This is a python learning project


## How to Play

To play the game, copy the code to your local environment and run the project.

Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the snake around the board. The objective is to eat food that appears on the board, which makes the snake grow longer. Each piece of food eaten increases your score by one point.

The game ends if the snake collides with itself. The goal is to make the snake as large as possible without crashing into its own body.
